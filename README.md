## About the System

### A Skin Cancer Classfication System built using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks in conjunction with a hair removal and segmentation pre-processing pipeline.

* #### Black Hat and Top Hat algorithms are used to remove black and white hairs from images respectively

* #### Saliency segmentation is used to isolate the region of interest in skin cancer images

* #### Segmented images are used to train the Deep Convolutional Neural Network
